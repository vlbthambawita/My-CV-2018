\subsection{Individual contributions}

\vspace{5pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Cache Optimization Techniques for the General
		Purpose Graphic Processing Unit:} \textit{MPhil Project}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{Achieving high-performance output using GPGPUs are not the easy task compared with normal programming concepts. In this research, the CPU memory optimization techniques have been adopted into the GPGPU to identify rare cache performance improvement techniques rather than common GPGPU’s best practices}}

%\newpage
\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{Low cost Tele-Presence Robot:} \textit{$4^{th}$ year undergraduate final project}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{The Tele-presence robot can be used to appear or present at a separate location virtually instead of human presenter. The robot which is built from low cost components achieves the task of Tele-presence robot}}

\vspace{6pt}

%\newpage

\item{\textbf{WIFI Robotic car:}\textit{Project developed for the department as an exhibition item}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{This robotic car is controlled remotely via WIFI network to drive into unaccessible locations. It is capable of giving a real time video feedback and sound feedback to the controlling end}}
